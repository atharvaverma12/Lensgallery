# LensGallery
I have built and deployed a photo-sharing application that includes user management, authentication, image uploads, and a PostgreSQL database. The backend is implemented in Golang, and for the frontend, I utilized Go templates. The code follows an MVC architecture, and I employed Docker to containerize the PostgreSQL database. Additionally, I implemented user authentication using cookies and sessions to ensure a secure environment for the users.
